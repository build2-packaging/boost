On the release:

- To be decided: how to upgrade upstream/ to the next Boost release. This will
  probably involve cloning the Boost superproject at
  https://github.com/boostorg/boost into upstream/ and removing upstream/.git,
  upstream/.gitmodules, and .git from all of the subprojects (for example
  those under upstream/libs/ and upstream/tools/).

  Once the process has been fleshed out, record the details in README-DEV.
