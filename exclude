# This library uses Boost.Context's ASM implementation (fcontext_t) directly
# which we have chosen not to compile for now. This seems like a mistake and
# the path of the header it includes being `boost/context/detail/fcontext.hpp`
# seems to confirm it.
#
# We may want to consider not even packaging this library because, in addition
# to the above problem, it's also been deprecated in favour of coroutine2. The
# only Boost library that depends on it is Boost.Asio and this is an optional
# and relatively weak dependency (see libboost-asio's `exclude_dependencies`
# entry in the `override` file).
