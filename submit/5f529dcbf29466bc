summary: The dynamic_bitset class represents a set of bits. It provides\
 accesses to the value of individual bits via an operator[] and provides all\
 of the bitwise operators that one can apply to builtin integers, such as\
 operatorsummary: boost-dynamic-bitset C++ library and operator<<. The number\
 of bits in the set is specified at runtime via a parameter to the\
 constructor of the dynamic_bitset
