project: boost
summary: The organization of boost integer headers and classes is designed to\
 take advantage of <stdint.h> types from the 1999 C standard without\
 resorting to undefined behavior in terms of the 1998 C++ standard. The\
 header <boost/cstdint.hpp> makes the standard integer types safely available\
 in namespace boost without placing any names in namespace std
