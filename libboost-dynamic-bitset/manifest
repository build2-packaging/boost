summary: The dynamic_bitset class represents a set of bits. It provides accesses to the value of individual bits via an operator[] and provides all of the bitwise operators that one can apply to builtin integers, such as operatorsummary: boost-dynamic-bitset C++ library and operator<<. The number of bits in the set is specified at runtime via a parameter to the constructor of the dynamic_bitset
